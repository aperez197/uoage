    <h3> Hi, My name is Angel Perez I was born in california and moved to utah when I was about 6 or 7 years old.
        I lived in Utah about 9 years it a great place if you like nature and activites that go along with being out side 
        I got involved with the boyscouts when I was about 11 years old and they tool me out camping,snowboarding,sliding 
        among other outside activites. I learned alot from my time with them not that i use many of the skilles in my day to day 
        life but Im grestfull for them. Then we moved to Illnoise aftersome time and that just a little about me.

 <h3>Ive learned many thing with i.c. stars but something that I didnt thnik Id learn were leadership skills and how to network 
    with people. Ive leaned how to just go up to people and start a conversation and that something i didnt so before.
    Also I learned things about my self and how it ok to change and do whatever you think is right. I hope that there is many
    more things I get to learnerd.

<h2> <b><u> Hobbies</u></b></h2>
<ul>
   <h3> reading</h3>
   <h3> writing stories</h3>
    <h3>watching anime</h3>
</ul>

 The reason I choose this hobbies is for one they kinda off all go with one another. I enjoy reading because you can learn 
    so much it can be from learning about a place that you've never been or a new word. For short stories I feel like it helps
    me release some strees by creating something that I have control over w
    hen I feel like I dont in my own life. I would say anime also helps me relax and even though Im not in control of the stories 
    it still allows me to get my mind of the thing that I might be having a hard time with.
